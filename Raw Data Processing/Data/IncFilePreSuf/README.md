# Prefix / Suffix .inc Files

Note that these files contain original Balmorel data at the moment
This is a temporary solution, until this pre-processing tool is able to produce data for the entire European scope of Balmorel
The goal is to ONLY have prefixes such as "TABLE DH(...) ..." and suffixes of merely ";", so no hardcoded data remain in the incfiles here.

That also means that you for now should be critical of the .inc-files, and copy paste your own data in here that may not be covered by the pre-processing scripts. Otherwise, delete the data in here if you are preparing your own datasets.
